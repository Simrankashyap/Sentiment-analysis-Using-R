# Sentiment-analysis-Using-R

It is the mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helping a business to understand the social sentiments of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations. 
In this repo, I'm performing sentiment analysis using R and have taken the text data from twitter and facebook after mining to know the rewiews of people to know the favor/against of Hilary and Trump.
